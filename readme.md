# FPL REST API

## Full Description

The idea of this API is to allow anyone who is developing an automated-managing system for the [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com) (FPL) to run their squad selecting algorithm through an entire year's worth of data in order to see how it would have performed in a season.

The solution uses an Express API which is connected to a Firebase database that holds data taken from JSON files on the FPL website.

Endpoints are currently being worked on, you can find a list of planned endpoints in the Node.js & Express Server document below.
