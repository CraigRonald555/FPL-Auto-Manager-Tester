# FPL Auto-Manager Test

## Full Description

The idea of this API is to allow anyone who is developing an automated-managing system for the [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com'>Fantasy Premier League) (FPL) to run their squad selecting algorithm through an entire year's worth of data in order to see how it would have performed in a season.

The plan is to have an Express API which is connected to a MySQL database that holds data taken from JSON files on the FPL website. This data will likely be parsed via a middleware in Express.
